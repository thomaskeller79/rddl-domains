    'description': '(mdp18) Cooperative Recon:\n\nsubmitted by Thomas Keller (based on the Recon domain by Tom Walsh submitted for IPC 2011).\n\nDescription: In the Cooperative Recon domain, the planner controls one or more planetary rovers that examine objects of interest in order to detect life and take a picture of it. As in the Recon domain of IPC 2011, first has to be detected before life is detected, and negative results (one for life, two for water) contaminate the object of interest such that no life can be detected. The main changes compared to the IPC 2011 Recon domain that have been realized are as follows:\n\n 1. In the 2011 version, taking pictures with a damaged camera lead to a negative reward, which is never a reasonable option (not taking a picture at all is always better). Here, we grant a lower positive reward instead, which makes for interesting decisions between returning to the base to repair the camera or go with the lower reward.\n\n 2. Hazards are replaced by a more general mechanism where probabilities that a tool is damaged are directly linked to the cell. However, the instance generation script still distributed hazards over the grid to compute these probabilities. The main difference is that hazards can overlap in a way that the probabilities accumulate.\n\n 3. In the IPC 2011 instance, all rovers were equipped with a tool to detect water, a tool to detect life and a camera. In the instances for IPC 2018, some rovers are only partially equipped such that the rovers have to collaborate to perform all required tests.\n\n 4. To emphasize colaboration even more, there is a novel support-agent action that rovers can take to increase the probability for successfully detecting life or water. This leads to interesting decisions between optimizing the probability of successfully detecting life and the number of objects of interest that can be examined within the finite horizon.',
